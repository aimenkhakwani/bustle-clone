    "text": "Ah, coffee. Nectar of the gods. The only thing that gets me up in the morning. The reason my eye is twitching right now. All of us coffee addicts probably know the feeling of getting a warm cup of coffee to get you through the day, cupping the mug in your hands to keep your fingers warm. It makes sense, right? One, it's cold outside and my fingers are usually the first part of my body to really feel it, so they need to be thawed. Two, how often are the little handles on the mug actually big enough for me to put my hand through? Not often enough. It's always super awkward (and kind of painful) when I have to try to hold an entire mug of hot coffee with one finger because the little loop between the mug and the handle is way too small. However, even though encircling your coffee mug in your hands makes sense, that's not the right way to hold a coffee cup.",

    "text": "When I’m suffering from Sunday scaries, looking ahead at my jam-packed week, I always feel a bit of anxiety when I have an open night. There are so many possibilities: I could take a hard workout class, I could meet my friends for happy hour, I could go home and watch TV while snuggling my dog… or I guess… I could go on a date. I don’t always feel this bored with dating: sometimes there’s nothing more I want to do than meet new people and take a chance over a round of beers with them. But there are other times when anything — and literally, anything! — seems better to me than dating. It’s always when this feeling strikes that I remind myself that I don’t have to date all the time to find love. And that sometimes, the best thing I can do for myself to actually attract this beloved person that I’ll share my life with is to stop looking for them and take a break from dating.",

    "title": "23 'Rejected Trump TV Shows' Tweets That Will Make You Laugh, Cry & Then Want To Vote Today",
    "author": "Joseph D. Lyons",
    "text": "From the depths of this presidential election comes a shining ray of hope in the form of clever tweets. The polls keep showing Hillary Clinton with a lead of about five points, but even that can't keep the unending allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump from bringing you down just a little (or a lot). Trump has denied everything (as I'm sure you remember by the way he insulted the women). So to beat back those blues, take a look at these 23 'Rejected Trump TV Shows' tweets. They'll make you laugh, cry, and then run to early voting. Now these, of course, can't be compared with The Apprentice, the reality show that made Trump a household name. That wasn't rejected; it was just put on hiatus. Trump's connection to it, though, was severed. When he announced his candidacy by insulting Mexican immigrants, NBC decided they better end their contract. Now it will reboot in January with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the helm. Trump — assuming that he's not in the White House — will have to get his own show up and running. These will probably not be in the running, but if he's in charge of the future Trump TV, who the heck knows?",
